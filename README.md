# PeriodiCode

**PeriodiCode - Toy Language Description:**

PeriodiCode is a toy programming language that combines elements from the periodic table with coding concepts, providing an interactive and playful coding experience.

The language operates within a data dictionary called "data," where variables and their corresponding values are stored. Users can declare variables and define functions using the names of chemical elements, adding a whimsical touch to their code. Here are some key features and functions of PeriodiCode:

**Code Snippets:**

1. `Hydrogen(x)`: Allows users to declare variables and store their values in the data dictionary.
   
   ```python
   Hydrogen x 10;
   ```

2. `Iron(variable)`: Retrieves and prints the value of a given variable from the data dictionary.
   
   ```python
   Iron x;
   ```

3. `Carbon(numbers)`: Calculates the sum of a list of numbers or variables, replacing variables with their corresponding values from the data dictionary.
   
   ```python
   Carbon x 5 3;
   ```

4. `Oxygen_for(start, end)`: Prints a range of numbers specified by the "start" and "end" arguments, considering variables and converting values as needed.
   
   ```python
   Oxygen_for 1 5;
   ```

5. `Oxygen_iter(sequence)`: Iterates over a sequence of elements, either a list or a variable, and prints each element.
   
   ```python
   Oxygen_iter sequence;
   ```

In addition to these functions, here's an example of how you can use PeriodiCode to add two numbers:

```python
Hydrogen num1 5;
Hydrogen num2 10;
Carbon "num1" "num2"
```

The above code declares two variables, `num1` and `num2`, assigns them values, and then uses the `Carbon` function to calculate their sum. The result will be printed as `15`.

PeriodiCode offers a playful and engaging environment for beginners or anyone seeking a creative and whimsical programming experience.
